- [x] Create documentation structure (docs/README.md)
- [x] Set up basic test framework structure
- [x] Verify development server works correctly

#### Actions Completed:
1. **âœ… Project Folder Structure Created**
   ```
   MiniJS-Framework/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # For core framework modules
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dom/               # For DOM abstraction layer
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events/            # For event handling system
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ state/             # For state management
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routing/           # For routing system
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js           # Main framework entry point âœ…
   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # For documentation
   â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todomvc/           # TodoMVC implementation
   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.html     # TodoMVC HTML structure âœ…
   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ style.css      # TodoMVC styling âœ…
   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ app.js         # TodoMVC app logic (placeholder) âœ…
   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # For test files
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Project configuration âœ…
   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules âœ…
   â””â”€â”€ index.html            # Development test page âœ…
   ```

2. **âœ… Development Environment Setup**
   - Created `index.html` as development test page with framework status monitoring
   - Set up `package.json` with npm scripts for development server
   - Added `.gitignore` for proper version control
   - Created basic framework entry point with module structure

3. **âœ… TodoMVC Foundation**
   - Created proper TodoMVC HTML structure following standard specification
   - Added TodoMVC CSS styling (complete implementation)
   - Set up placeholder JavaScript file for future implementation

#### Project Structure Design:
```
MiniJS-Framework/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Framework source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Core framework modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dom/               # DOM abstraction layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events/            # Event handling system
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ state/             # State management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routing/           # Routing system
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js           # Main framework entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # Documentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Framework documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/              # Example applications
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todomvc/           # TodoMVC implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
â””â”€â”€ index.html            # Development test page
```

#### âœ… Issue #1 COMPLETED Successfully!

**What was accomplished:**
- Complete project folder structure created with proper organization
- Development environment fully set up and tested
- Basic framework entry point implemented with module structure
- TodoMVC foundation laid with proper HTML/CSS structure
- Documentation framework established
- Test framework structure created
- Development server confirmed working (http://localhost:8080)

**Verification:**
- âœ… Development server runs successfully on port 8080
- âœ… Main test page loads and shows framework status
- âœ… TodoMVC page structure is accessible
- âœ… All required directories and files are in place
- âœ… Framework loads without errors and shows proper initialization

#### Next Steps - Ready for Issue #2:
**Issue #2: Implement DOM Abstraction Layer**
- Start implementing core DOM manipulation functions
- Create element creation, attribute management, and nesting capabilities
- Build the foundation for the framework's virtual DOM-like system

---

### Issue #2: Implement DOM Abstraction Layer ðŸ”„

**Date:** 2025-07-01
**Status:** Ready to Start
**Objective:** Create methods to handle DOM manipulation through JavaScript objects

#### Tasks to Complete:
- [ ] Create element creation function (createElement equivalent)
- [ ] Implement attribute management (setAttribute, getAttribute, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for element nesting (appendChild equivalent)
- [ ] Create text content management
- [ ] Implement basic CSS class management
- [ ] Add element removal functionality
- [ ] Create utility functions for common DOM operations

#### Technical Requirements:
- Must work with virtual DOM-like object structure
- Should be more intuitive than native DOM API
- Must support the JSON-like structure shown in instructions
- Should integrate with the framework's event system (when implemented)

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Can create elements programmatically using framework syntax
- Can add/remove attributes and classes easily
- Can nest elements properly with parent-child relationships
- Works with the framework's component system
- More intuitive than native DOM API

---

## Technical Decisions

### Framework Architecture
- **Modular Design:** Separate modules for each core feature
- **No External Dependencies:** Pure JavaScript implementation
- **Virtual DOM Approach:** JSON-like object structure for DOM manipulation
- **Event-Driven:** Custom event system different from addEventListener

### Development Environment
- **Simple Setup:** Minimal tooling to focus on framework development
- **Local Development:** Basic HTTP server for testing
- **Modular Structure:** Easy to understand and maintain

---

## Notes and Considerations

### From Instructions Analysis:
- Framework must implement DOM abstraction, routing, state management, and event handling
- TodoMVC must match standard specification exactly
- Documentation must be comprehensive with code examples
- No external frameworks/libraries allowed (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)

### From Audit Requirements:
- Must pass all TodoMVC functionality tests
- Documentation must explain how framework works
- Code must follow good practices
- Performance should be reasonable
